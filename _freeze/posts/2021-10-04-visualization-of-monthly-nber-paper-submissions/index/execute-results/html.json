See the post below for the data source.\ndate: 10-04-2021\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n*Get the data sets from here: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-09-28/readme.md*\n\n:::{.column-margin}\nGet the updates about this visualization and full code from here: https://github.com/ashgreat/tidytuesday/tree/main/2021-10-01-NBER\n:::\n\nAnecdotally I had heard that many economists were submitting tons of papers to NBER during the Covid-19 pandemic. However, it was not clear to me whether this was a trend or a flash in the pan. The following visualization show that the spike in 2020 was primarily in one month.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhich month saw the spike? This table shows that it was in May 2020. Top 6 months with highest submissions are in 2020.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n| year| month|   n|\n|----:|-----:|---:|\n| 2020|     5| 223|\n| 2020|     7| 176|\n| 2020|    10| 168|\n| 2020|     6| 165|\n| 2020|    12| 156|\n| 2020|     4| 152|\n| 2016|    12| 143|\n| 2013|     8| 134|\n| 2018|     9| 134|\n| 2015|     7| 132|\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLet's annotate the earlier plot with the spike in may 2020.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Sub-areas of Economics submitting in May 2020\n\nNext, let's visualize the top subcategories submitting in May 2020. I expected these to be from Heath Care and Heath Economics. But is that the case?\n\nCreate a merged data set with `papers` and `programs`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nNext get the top 10 fields by submissions in May 2020:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nTake a look at these fields\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|program_desc                                   |  n|\n|:----------------------------------------------|--:|\n|Public Economics                               | 62|\n|Health Economics                               | 58|\n|Economic Fluctuations and Growth               | 56|\n|Labor Studies                                  | 47|\n|Corporate Finance                              | 34|\n|Health Care                                    | 30|\n|Asset Pricing                                  | 29|\n|Development Economics                          | 25|\n|International Finance and Macroeconomics       | 24|\n|Productivity, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship | 23|\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow we are ready to create a bar plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLet's fill the first 3 bars with a different color. Also, using `str_swap` function from `sringr` package (bundled with `tidyvere` so you don't have to install it separately) wrap the axis labels.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHow does the distribution of the top 10 most submitted program descriptions look like? First, get the top 10 most popular programs of all times.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nWe can compare individual distributions using `facet_wrap`. But there is a better way to compare these distributions over time using `ggridges` package.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAlthough almost all the top-10 fields experienced increases in 2020 submissions, International Trade and Finance related submissions were flat. Corporate Finance submissions saw a sharper bump compared to Asset Pricing, which both belong to Finance.\n",
